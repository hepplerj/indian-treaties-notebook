         James Madison, president of the United States of America, by general John Coffee, John
         Rhea, and John M'Kee, esquires, commissioners on the part of the United States, duly
         authorized for that purpose, on the one part, and the mingoes, leaders, captains, and warriors,
         of the Choctaw nation, in general council assembled, in behalf of themselves and the whole
         nation, on the other part, have entered into the following articles, which, when ratified by the
         president of the United States, with the advice and consent of the senate, shall be obligatory
         on both parties:
         
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 1.
      
      
         The Choctaw nation, for the consideration hereafter mentioned, cede to the
         United States all their title and claim to lands lying east of the following boundary, beginning
         at the mouth of Ooktibbuha, the Chickasaw boundary, and running from thence down the
         Tombigby river, until it intersects the northern boundary of a cession made to the United
         States by the Choctaws, at Mount Dexter, on the 16th November, 1805.
         
      
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 2.
      
      
         In consideration of the foregoing cession, the United States engage to pay to the
         Choctaw nation the sum of six thousand dollars annually, for twenty years; they also agree to
         pay them in merchandise, to be delivered immediately on signing the present treaty, the sum of
         ten thousand dollars.
         
      
      
      
      
      Done and executed in full and open council, at the Choctaw trading house, this
