      In consideration of the foregoing agreements, stipulations, and cessions, and on condition of their faithful observance, the
      
      Page 738
      
      United States agree to expend, annually, for the Piegan, Blood, Blackfoot, and Gros Ventres tribes of Indians, constituting
         the Blackfoot Nation, in addition to the goods and provisions distributed at the time of signing the treaty, twenty thousand dollars,
         annually, for ten years, to be expended in such useful goods and provisions, and other articles, as the President, as his
         discretion, may from time to time determine; and the superintendent, or other proper officer, shall each year inform the President
         of the wishes of the Indians in relation thereto: Provided, however, That if, in the judgment of the President and Senate, this amount be deemed insufficient, it may be increased not to exceed
         the sum of thirty-five thousand dollars per year.
      
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 10.
      
      The United States further agree to expend annually, for the benefit of the aforesaid tribes of the Blackfoot Nation, a sum
         not exceeding fifteen thousand dollars annually, for ten years, in establishing and instructing them in agricultural and mechanical
         pursuits, and in educating their children, and in any other respect promoting their civilization and Christianization: Provided, however, That to accomplish the objects of this article, the President may, at his discretion, apply any or all the annuities provided for in this treaty:
         And provided, also, That the President may, at his discretion, determine in what proportions the said annuities shall be divided among the several
         tribes.
      
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 11.
      
      The aforesaid tribes acknowledge their dependence on the Government of the United States, and promise to be friendly with all citizens thereof, and to commit no depredations or other violence upon such citizens. And
         should any one or more violate this pledge, and the fact be proved to the satisfaction of the President, the property taken
         shall be returned, or, in default thereof, or if injured or destroyed, compensation may be made by the Government out of the
         annuities. The aforesaid tribes are hereby bound to deliver such offenders to the proper authorities for trial and punishment,
         and are held responsible, in their tribal capacity, to make reparation for depredations so committed.
         Nor will they make war upon any other tribes, except in self-defense, but will submit all matter of difference, between themselves and other
         Indians, to the Government of the United States, through its agents, for adjustment, and will abide thereby. And if any of
         the said Indians, parties to this treaty, commit depredations on any other Indians within the jurisdiction of the United States, the same rule shall prevail as that prescribed
         in this article in case of depredations against citizens. And the said tribes agree not to shelter or conceal offenders against the laws of the United States, but to deliver them up to the authorities for trial.
      
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 12.
      
      It is agreed and understood, by and between the parties to this treaty, that if any nation or tribe of Indians aforesaid,
         shall violate any of the agreements, obligations, or stipulations, herein contained, the United States may withhold, for such length
         of time as the President and Congress may determine, any portion or all of the annuities agreed to be paid to said nation
         or tribe under the ninth and tenth articles of this treaty.
      
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 13.
      
      The nations and tribes of Indians, parties to this treaty, desire to exclude from their country the use of ardent spirits or other intoxicating liquor, and to prevent their people from drinking the same. Therefore it is provided,
         that any Indian belonging to said tribes who is guilty of bringing such liquor into the Indian country, or who drinks liquor,
         may have his or her proportion of the annuities withheld from him or her, for such time as the President may determine.
      
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 14.
      
      The aforesaid nations and tribes of Indians, west of the Rocky Mountains, parties to this treaty, do agree, in consideration
         of
      
      
      Page 739
      
      the provisions already made for them in existing treaties, to accept the guarantees of the peaceful occupation of their hunting-grounds,
         east of the Rocky Mountains, and of remuneration for depredations made by the other tribes, pledged to be secured to them
         in this treaty out of the annuities of said tribes, in full compensation for the concessions which they, in common with the said
         tribes, have made in this treaty.
         The Indians east of the mountains, parties to this treaty, likewise recognize and accept the guarantees of this treaty, in
         full compensation for the injuries or depredations which have been, or may be committed by the aforesaid tribes, west of the
         Rocky Mountains.
      
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 15.
      
      The annuities of the aforesaid tribes shall not be taken to pay the debts of individuals.
      
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 16.
      
      
         This treaty shall be obligatory upon the aforesaid nations and tribes of Indians, parties hereto, from the date hereof, and
         upon the United States as soon as the same shall be ratified by the President and Senate.
