      WHEREAS by an act of Congress entitled “An act for the relief of the Stockbridge tribe of Indians, in the Territory of Wisconsin,”
         approved on the third day of March, A. D. 1843, it was provided that the township of land on the east side of Winnebago Lake,
         secured to said tribe by the treaty with the Menomonee Indians of February 8th,
      
      
      Page 575
      
      1831, as amended by the Senate of the United States, and not heretofore ceded by said tribe to the United States, should be
         divided and allotted among the individual members of said tribe, by commissioners to be elected for that purpose, who were
         to make report of such division and allotment, and thereupon the persons composing said tribe were to become citizens of the
         United States.And whereas a portion of said tribe refused to recognize the validity of said act of Congress, or the proceedings which were
         had under it, or to be governed by its provisions, and upon their petition a subsequent act was passed by the Congress of the United States, on the 6th day of August, 1846, repealing the said act of
         March 3d, 1843, and providing, among other things, that such of said tribe as should enroll themselves with the subagent of
         Indians affairs at Green Bay, should be and remain citizens of the United States, and the residue of said tribe were restored
         to their ancient form of government as an Indian tribe. It was also provided that the said township of land should be divided
         into two districts, one of which was to be known as the “Indian district,” the other as the “citizen district;” the former
         to be held in common by the party who did not desire citizenship, and the latter to be divided and allotted among such as
         were citizens and desired to remain so.And whereas it has been found impracticable to carry into full effect the provisions of the act of August 6th, 1846, by dividing
         the said township of land in the manner specified in said act, without infringing upon private rights acquired in good faith
         under the act of 1843 hereinbefore referred to, with a view of relieving both the Indian and citizen parties of said Stockbridge
         tribe of Indians from their present embarrassments, and to secure to each their just rights, articles of agreement and compromise
         have been entered into, as follows:
      
      
      Articles of agreement and treaty made and concluded at Stockbridge, in the State of Wisconsin, on the 24th day of November,
            in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and forty-eight, by and between the undersigned, acting commissioners on
            the part of the United States of America, and the Stockbridge tribe of Indians.
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 1.
      
      The said Stockbridge tribe of Indians renounce an participation in any of the benefits or privileges granted or conferred by the act of Congress entitled “An act
         for the relief of the Stockbridge tribe of Indians, in the Territory of Wisconsin,” approved March 3, 1843, and relinquish
         all rights secured by said act; and they do hereby acknowledge and declare themselves to be under the protection and guardianship of the United States, as other Indian tribes.
      
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 2.
      
      That no misunderstanding may exist, now or hereafter, in determining who compose said tribe and are parties hereto, it is agreed that a roll or census shall be taken and appended to this agreement, and in like
         manner taken annually hereafter, and returned to the Secretary of the War Department of the United States, containing the
         names of all such as are parties hereto, and to be known and recognized as the Stockbridge tribe of Indians, who shall each
         be entitled to their due proportion of the benefits to be derived from the provisions made for their tribe by this and former
         agreements; and whenever any of them shall separate themselves from said tribe, or abandon the country which may be selected
         for their future home, the share or portion of such shall cease, and they shall forfeit all claims to be recognized as members
         of said tribe.
      
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 3.

      ARTICLE 4.
      
      The said township of land shall be surveyed into lots, in conformity with the plan adopted by the commissioners elected under the act of March
         3, 1843, and such of said lands as were allotted by said commissioners to members of said tribe who have become citizens of
         the United States (a schedule of which is hereunto annexed) are hereby confirmed to such individuals respectively, and patents
         therefor shall be issued by the United States. The residue of said lands belonging to the United States shall be brought into market but shall not be sold at less than the appraised
         value, unless the Senate of the United States shall otherwise determine.
      
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 5.
      
      In consideration of the cession and relinquishment hereinbefore made by the said Stockbridge tribe of Indians, it is agreed
         that the United States shall pay to said tribe, within six months after the ratification of this agreement, the sum of sixteen thousand five hundred dollars,
         to enable them to settle their affairs, obtain necessaries, and make provision for establishing themselves in a new home.
      
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 6.
      
      The United States shall also pay to said tribe, within six months after the ratification of this agreement, the sum of fourteen
         thousand five hundred and four dollars and eighty-five cents, being the appraised value of their improvements upon the lands herein ceded and relinquished to the United States, and to be paid to the individuals claiming
         said improvements according to the schedule and assessment herewith transmitted.
      
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 7.
      
      It is further stipulated and agreed that the said Stockbridge tribe may remain upon the lands they now occupy for one year after the ratification of this agreement, and that they will
         remove to the country set apart for them, or such other west of the Mississipi River as they may be able to secure, where
         all their treaty stipulations with the Government shall be carried into effect.
      
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 8.
      
      Whenever the said Stockbridge tribe shall signify their wish to emigrate, the United States will defray the expenses of their removal west of the Mississippi and furnish them with subsistence for one year after their arrival at their
         new home.
      
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 9.

         sum of sixteen thousand five hundred dollars shall be invested by the United States in stock, bearing an interest of not less than five per cent. per annum, the interest of which
         shall be paid annually to said tribe, as other annuities are paid by the United States.
      
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 10.
      
      It is agreed that nothing herein shall prevent a survey of said lands, at any time after the ratification of this agreement, and that said tribe shall commit no

      ARTICLE 11.
      
      The United States will pay the expenses incurred by the sachem and head-men, amounting to three thousand dollars, in attending to the business of
         said tribe since the year 1843.
      
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 12.
      
      This agreement to be binding and obligatory upon the contracting parties from and after its ratification by the Government
         of the United States.

         SUPPLEMENTAL ARTICLE.
      
      
      Whereas the Stockbridge and Munsee Indians consider that they have a claim against the United States for indemnity for certain lands on White River in the State of Indiana, and for certain
         other lands in the State of Wisconsin, which they allege they have been deprived of by treaties entered into with the Miamies
         and Delawares, or to the lands claimed by them in Indiana, and with the Menomonees and Winnebagoes, or to the lands in Wisconsin,
         without their consent; and whereas the said Stockbridge and Munsee Indians, by their chiefs and agents, have continued to
         prosecute their said claims during the last twenty years at their own expense, except the sum of three thousand dollars paid
         them in 1821; and whereas it is desirable that all ground of discontent on the part of said Indians shall be removed, the
         United States do further stipulate, in consideration of the relinquishment by them of said claims, and all other, except as provided in this treaty, to pay the sachems or chiefs of said
         Indians, on the ratification of this article by them, with the assent of their people, the sum of five thousand dollars, and
         the further sum of twenty thousand dollars, to be paid in ten annual instalments, to commence when the said Indians shall
         have selected and removed to their new homes, as contemplated by the seventh article of this treaty.The President of the United States, within two years from the ratification of this treaty, shall procure for the use of said
         Stockbridge Indians a quantity of land west of the Mississippi River, upon which they shall reside, not less than seventy-two
         sections, said Indians to be consulted as to the location of said land, and to be holden by the same tenure as other Indian
         lands.
