            of the confederated tribes and bands of Indians, residing in Middle Oregon, they being duly authorized thereto by their respective
            bands, to wit: Symtustus, Locks-quis-sa, Shick-a-me, and Kuck-up, chiefs of the Taih or Upper De Chutes band of Walla - Wallas;
            Stocket-ly and Iso, chiefs of the Wyam or Lower De Chutes band of Walla - Wallas; Alexis and Talkish, chiefs of the Tenino

            chief of the Dog River band of Wascoes.
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 1.
      
      The above-named confederated bands of Indians cede to the United States all their right, title, and claim to all and every part of the country claimed by them, included
         in the following boundaries, to wit:Commencing in the middle of the Columbia River, at the Cascade Falls, and running thence southerly to the summit of the Cascade
         Mountains; thence along said summit to the forty-fourth parallel of north latitude; thence east on that parallel to the summit
         of the Blue Mountains, or the western boundary of the Sho-sho-ne or Snake country; thence northerly along that summit to a point due east from the head-waters
         of Willow Creek; thence west to the head-waters of said creek; thence down said stream to its junction with the Columbia River;
         and thence down the channel of the Columbia River to the place of beginning. Provided, however, that so much of the country described above as is contained in the following boundaries, shall, until otherwise directed
         by the President of the United States, be set apart as a residence for said Indians, which tract for the purposes contemplated
         shall be held and regarded as an Indian reservation, to wit:Commencing in the middle of the channel of the De Chutes River opposite the eastern termination of a range of high lands usually
         known as the Mutton Mountains; thence westerly to the summit of said range, along the divide to its connection with the Cascade
         Mountains;
      
      
      Page 715
      
      thence to the summit of said mountains; thence southerly to Mount Jefferson; thence down the main branch of De Chutes River;
         heading in this peak, to its junction with De Chutes River; and thence down the middle of the channel of said river to the
         place of beginning. All of which tract shall be set apart, and, so far as necessary, surveyed and marked out for their exclusive
         use; nor shall any white person be permitted to reside upon the same without the concurrent permission of the agent and superintendent.The said bands and tribes agree to remove to and settle upon the same within one year after the ratification of this treaty, without
         any additional expense to the United States other than is provided for by this treaty; and, until the expiration of the time
         specified, the said bands shall be permitted to occupy and reside upon the tracts now possessed by them, guaranteeing to all
         white citizens the right to enter upon and occupy as settlers ay lands not included in said reservation, and not actually
         inclosed by said Indians. Provided, however, That prior to the removal of said Indians to said reservation, and before any improvements contemplated by this treaty shall
         have been commenced, that if the three principal bands, to wit: the Wascopum, Tiah, or Upper De Chutes, and the Lower De Chutes
         bands of Walla-Wallas shall express in council, a desire that some other reservation may be selected for them, that the three bands named may select each three persons of their respective bands,
         who with the superintendent of Indian affairs or agent, as may by him be directed, shall proceed to examine, and if another
         location can be selected, better suited to the condition and wants of said Indians, that is unoccupied by the whites, and
         upon which the board of commissioners thus selected may agree, the same shall be declared a reservation for said Indians,
         instead of the tract named in this treaty. Provided, also, That the exclusive right of taking fish in the streams running through and bordering said reservation is hereby secured to said
         Indians; and at all other usual and accustomed stations, in common with citizens, of the United States, and of erecting suitable
         houses for curing the same; also the privilege of hunting, gathering roots and berries, and pasturing their stock on unclaimed
         lands, in common with citizens, is secured to them. And provided, also, That if any band or bands of Indians, residing in and claiming any portion or portions of the country in this article, shall not accede to the terms of this treaty, then the bands becoming parties hereunto agree to receive such part of the several and
         other payments herein named as a consideration for the entire country described as aforesaid as shall be in the proportion
         that their aggregate number may have to the whole number of Indians residing in and claiming the entire country aforesaid,
         as consideration and payment in full for the tracts in said country claimed by them. And provided, also, That where substantial improvements have been made by any members of the bands being parties to this treaty, who are compelled to abandon
         them in consequence of said treaty, the same shall be valued, under the direction of the President of the United States, and
         payment made therefor; or, in lieu of said payment, improvements of equal extent and value at their option shall be made for
         them on the tracts assigned to each respectively.
      
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 2.
      
      In consideration of, and payment for, the country hereby ceded, the United States agree to pay the bands and tribes of Indians claiming territory and residing in said country, the several sums
         of money following, to wit:Eight thousand dollars per annum for the first five years, commencing on the first day of September, 1856, or as soon thereafter
         as practicable.Six thousand dollars per annum for the term of five years next succeeding the first five.
      
      
      Page 716
      
      Four thousand dollars per annum for the term of five years next succeeding the second five; andTwo thousand dollars per annum for the term of five years next succeeding the third five.All of which several sums of money shall be expended for the use and benefit of the confederated bands, under the direction of the President of the United States,
         who may from time to time, at his discretion determine what proportion thereof shall be expended for such objects as in his
         judgment will promote their well-being and advance them in civilization; for their moral improvement and education; for building,
         opening and fencing farms, breaking land, providing teams, stock, agricultural implements, seeds, &c.; for clothing, provisions,
         and tools; for medical purposes, providing mechanics and farmers, and for arms and ammunition.
      
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 3.
      
      The United States agree to pay said Indians the additional sum of fifty thousand dollars, a portion whereof shall be applied to the payment for such articles as may be advanced
         them at the time of signing this treaty, and in providing, after the ratification thereof and prior to their removal, such
         articles as may be deemed by the President essential to their want; for the erection of buildings on the reservation, fencing
         and opening farms; for the purchase of teams, farming implements, clothing and provisions, tools, seeds, and for the payment
         of employees; and for subsisting the Indians the first year after their removal.
      
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 4.
      
      In addition to the considerations specified the United States agree to erect, at suitable points on the reservation, one sawmill and one flouring-mill; suitable hospital buildings; one school-house; one blacksmith-shop with a tin and a gunsmith-shop
         thereto attached; one wagon and ploughmaker shop; and for one sawyer, one miller, one superintendent of farming operations,
         a farmer, a physician, a school-teacher, a blacksmith, and a wagon and ploughmaker, a dwelling house and the requisite outbuildings
         for each; and to purchase and keep in repair for the time specified for furnishing employees all necessary mill-fixtures,
         mechanics tools, medicines and hospital stores, books and stationery for schools, and furniture for employees.The United States further engage to secure and pay for the services and subsistence, for the term of fifteen years, of one farmer, one blacksmith, and one wagon and plough maker; and for the term of twenty years, of one physician, one sawyer,
         one miller. One superintendent of farming operations, and one school teacher.The United States also engage to erect four dwelling-houses, one for the head chief of the confederated bands, and one each for the Upper and Lower De Chutes
         bands of Walla-Wallas, and for the Wascopum band of Wascoes, and to fence and plough for each of the said chiefs ten acres
         of land; also to pay the head chief of the confederated bands a salary of five hundred dollars per annum for twenty years,
         commencing six months after the three principal bands named in this treaty shall have removed to the reservation, or as soon
         thereafter as a head chief should be elected: And provided, also, That at any time when by the death, resignation, or removal of the chief selected, there shall be a vacancy and a successor
         appointed or selected, the salary, the dwelling, and improvements shall be possessed by said successor, so long as he shall
         occupy the position as head chief; so also with reference to the dwellings and improvements provided for by this treaty for
         the head chiefs of the three principal bands named.
      
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 5.
      
      The President may, from time to time, at his discretion, cause the whole, or such portion as he may think proper, of the tract
         that may now or hereafter be set apart as a permanent home for these Indians, to be surveyed into lots and assigned to such Indians of the confederated bands as may wish
         to enjoy the privilege, and locate
      
      
      Page 717
      
      thereon permanently. To a single person over twenty-one years of age, forty acres; to a family of two persons, sixty acres;

         and twenty acres; and to each family over ten in number, twenty acres for each additional three members. And the President
         may provide such rules and regulations as will secure to the family in case of the death of the head thereof the possession
         and enjoyment of such permanent home and the improvement thereon; and he may, at any time, at his discretion, after such person
         or family has made location on the land assigned as a permanent home, issue a patent to such person or family for such assigned land, conditioned that the tract shall not be aliened or leased for a longer
         term than two years and shall be exempt from levy, sale, or forfeiture, which condition shall continue in force until a State
         constitution embracing such lands within its limits shall have been formed, and the legislature of the State shall remove the restrictions. Provided, however, That no State legislature shall remove the restrictions herein provided for without the consent of congress. And provided, also, That if any person or family shall at any time neglect or refuse to occupy or till a portion of the land assigned and on
         which they have located, or shall roam from place to place indicating a desire to abandon his home, the President may, if
         the patent shall have been issued, revoke the same, and if not issued, cancel the assignment, and may also withhold from such person, or family, their portion of the annuities, or other money due
         them, until they shall have returned to such permanent home and resumed the pursuits of industry, and in default of their
         return the tract may be declared abandoned, and thereafter assigned to some other person or family of Indians residing on
         said reservation.

      The confederated bands acknowledge their dependence on the Government of the United States, and promise to be friendly with all the citizens thereof, and pledge themselves to commit no depredation on the property of said citizens; and should any one or more of the Indians violate this pledge,
         and the fact be satisfactorily proven before the agent, the property taken shall be returned, or in default thereof, or if
         injured or destroyed, compensation may be made by the Government out of their annuities; nor will they make war on any other tribe of Indians except in self-defence, but submit all matters of difference between
         them and other Indians to the Government of the United States, or its agents for decision, and abide thereby; and if any of
         the said Indians commit any depredations on other Indians, the same rule shall prevail as that prescribed in the case of depredations

         or her for such time as the President may determine.
      
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 9.
      
      The said confederated bands agree that whensoever, in the opinion of the President of the United States, the public interest
         may require it, that all roads, highways, and railroads shall have the right of way through the reservation herein designated, or which may
         at any time hereafter be set apart as a reservation for said Indians.This treaty shall be obligatory on the contracting parties as soon as the same shall be ratified by the President and Senate
         of the United States.
