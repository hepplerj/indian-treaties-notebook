      Inasmuch as the Government of the United States is desirous to arrest the effusion of blood between the Indian tribes within

         thereof, the Government of the United States agree to pay to the said band the sum of seven thousand dollars annually, for twenty years, in such articles as the Secretary of the

         Any amendment or modification of this treaty by the [Senate of the United States shall be considered final and binding upon the]
