         concessions for the offence. And, for the purpose of removing all further or future cause of misunderstanding as respects
         trade and friendly intercourse between the parties, the above named Commissioners on the part of the United States, and the
         undersigned Chiefs and Warriors of the Ricara Tribe of Indians on the part of said Tribe, have made and entered into the following
         articles and conditions, which, when ratified by the President of the United States, by and with the advice and consent of

      ARTICLE 1.

         of the United States.
      
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 4.

         by the President of the United States, through his agents; and none but American citizens, duly authorized by the United States,
         shall be admitted to trade or hold intercourse with said tribe of Indians.
      
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 5.
