         such policy it is agreed that hereafter the permanent of the various bands of said Indians shall be upon the separate reservations
         hereinafter described and set apart. Said Indians, acknowledging the right of the chiefs and headmen of the various bands

         of their separate reservations, hereby agree to accept and abide by such agreements and conditions as to the location and
         boundaries of such reservations as may be made and agreed upon by the United States and the band or bands for which such separate
         reservation may be made, and as the said separate boundaries may be herein set forth.
      
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 2.
      
      The said Indians do hereby relinquish and cede to the United States all of the Great Sioux Reservation— as reserved to them by the treaty of 1868, and modified by the agreement of 1876—not herein specifically

         reservations to which they are herein assigned as their permanent homes, and they do hereby severally relinquish to the other

         twenty acres of land, under Article 6, of the treaty of 1868, may, in the manner and form therein prescribed, select and secure
         for purposes of cultivation, in addition to said three hundred and twenty acres, a tract of land not exceeding eighty (80)
         acres within his reservation, for each of his children, living at the ratification of this agreement, under the age of eighteen
         (18) years; and such child, upon arriving at the age of eighteen years shall have such selection certified to him or her in
         lieu of the selection granted in the second clause of said Article 6; but no right of alienation or encumbrance is acquired
         by such selection and occupation; unless hereafter authorized by act of Congress.
      
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 4.

      the occupants of each of said separate reservations shall receive such proportion as the number of Indians thereon bears to
         the whole number of Indian parties to this agreement. All of the said cattle and their progeny shall bear the brand of the Indian department, and shall be held subject to the disposal of said
         department, and shall not be sold, exchanged or slaughtered, except by consent or order of the agent in charge, until such
         time as this restriction shall be removed by the Cmmissioner of Indian Affairs.

         faith, select land within the reservation to which such lodge or family belongs, and begin the cultivation thereof, one good
         cow, and one well broken pair of oxen, with yoke and chain, within reasonable time after making such selection and settlement.

      ARTICLE 8.
      
      The provisions of the treaty of 1868, and the agreement of 1876, except as herein modified, shall continue in full force.This agreement shall not be binding upon either party until it shall have received the approval of the President and Congress
         of the United States.
