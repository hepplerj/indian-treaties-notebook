      Articles of a Treaty entered into and concluded at Fort Armstrong, by and between Thomas Forsyth, Agent of Indian Affairs,
            authorized on the part of the United States for that purpose, of the one part, and the Chiefs, Warriors, and Head Men, of
            the United Sac and Fox Tribes, for themselves and their Tribes, of the other part.
      
      WHEREAS by the ninth article of the Treaty made and entered into between the United States and the Sac and Fox Tribes of Indians, concluded
         and signed at Saint Louis, in the District of Louisiana, on the third day of November, one thousand eight hundred and four,
         it is stipulated, in order to put a stop to the abuses and impositions which are practised upon the said Tribes by the private
         traders, the United States will, at a convenient time, establish a trading house or factory, where the individuals of the
         said Tribes can be supplied with goods at a more reasonable rate than they have been accustomed to procure them. Now, We,
         the said Chiefs, Warriors, and head men of the said Tribes, for and in consideration of the sum of one thousand dollars to
         us, now paid in merchandise out of the United States' Factory, by said Thomas Forsyth, on behalf of the United States, the
         receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, do exonerate, release, and forever discharge, the United States from the obligation
         contained in the said ninth article above recited, and the aforesaid ninth article is, from the date hereof, abrogated and
         of no effect.
