            Alfred H. Terry, General C. C. Augur, J. B. Henderson, Nathaniel G. Taylor, John B. Sanborn, and Samuel F. Tappan, duly appointed
            commissioners on the part of the United States, and the different bands of the Sioux Nation of Indians, by their chiefs and
            head-men, whose names are hereto subscribed, they being duly authorized to act in the premises.
      
      
      ARTICLE 1.
      
      From this day forward all war between the parties to this agreement shall forever cease. The Government of the United States desires peace, and its
         honor is hereby pledged to keep it. The Indians desire peace, and they now pledge their honor to maintain it.If bad men among the whites, or among other people subject to the authority of the United States, shall commit any wrong upon
         the person or property of the Indians, the United States will, upon proof made to the agent and forwarded to the Commissioner
         of Indian Affairs at Washington City, proceed at once to cause the offender to be arrested and punished according to the laws of the United States, and also re-imburse the injured person for
         the loss sustained.If bad men among the Indians shall commit a wrong or depredation upon the person or property of any one, white, black, or
         Indians, subject to the authority of the United States, and at peace therewith, the Indians herein named solemnly agree that
         they will, upon proof made to their agent and notice by him, deliver up the wrong-doer to the United States, to be tried and punished according to its laws; and in case they wilfully refuse so to do,
         the person injured shall be re-imbursed for his loss from the annuities or other moneys due or to become due to them under
         this or other treaties made with the United States. And the President, on advising with the Commissioner of Indian Affairs,
         shall prescribe such rules and regulations for ascertaining damages under the provisions of this article as in his judgment may be proper. But no one sustaining loss while violating
         the provisions of this treaty or the laws of the United States shall be re-imbursed therefor.
      
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 2.
      
      The United States agrees that the following district of country, to wit, viz: commencing on the east bank of the Missouri
         River where the forty-sixth parallel of north latitude crosses the same, thence along low-water mark down said east bank to
         a point opposite where the northern line of the State of Nebraska strikes the river, thence west across said river, and along
         the northern line of Nebraska to the one hundred and fourth degree of longitude west from Greenwich, thence north on said
         meridian to a point where the forty-sixth parallel of north latitude intercepts the same, thence due east along said parallel
         to the place of beginning; and in addition thereto, all existing reservations on the east bank of said river shall be, and the same is, set apart for the absolute and undisturbed use and
         occupation of the Indians herein named, and for such other friendly tribes or individual Indians as from time to time they
         may be willing, with the consent of the United States, to admit amongst them; and the United States now solemnly agrees that
         no persons except those herein designated and authorized so to do, and except such officers, agents, and employés of the Government
         as may be authorized to enter upon Indian reservations in discharge of duties enjoined by law, shall ever be permitted to
         pass over, settle upon, or reside in the territory
      
      
      Page 999
      
      described in this article, or in such territory as may be added to this reservation for the use of said Indians, and henceforth
         they will and do hereby relinquish all claims or right in and to any portion of the United States or Territories, except such
         as is embraced within the limits aforesaid, and except as hereinafter provided.
      
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 3.
      
      If it should appear from actual survey or other satisfactory examination of said tract of land that it contains less than
         one hundred and sixty acres of tillable land for each person who, at the time, may be authorized to reside on it under the
         provisions of this treaty, and a very considerable number of such persons shall be disposed to commence cultivating the soil
         as farmers, the United States agrees to set apart, for the use of said Indians, as herein provided, such additional quantity of arable land, adjoining to said reservation, or as near to the same as it can be obtained, as may be
         required to provide the necessary amount.
      
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 4.
      
      The United States agrees, at its own proper expense, to construct at some place on the Missouri River, near the center of
         said reservation, where timber and water may be convenient, the following buildings, to wit: a warehouse, a store-room for the
         use of the agent in storing goods belonging to the Indians, to cost not less than twenty-five hundred dollars; an agency-building
         for the residence of the agent, to cost not exceeding three thousand dollars; a residence for the physician, to cost not more
         than three thousand dollars; and five other buildings, for a carpenter, farmer, blacksmith, miller, and engineer, each to
         cost not exceeding two thousand dollars; also a school-house or mission-building, so soon as a sufficient number of children
         can be induced by the agent to attend school, which shall not cost exceeding five thousand dollars.The United States agrees further to cause to be erected on said reservation, near the other buildings herein authorized, a
         good steam circular-saw mill, with a grist-mill and shingle-machine attached to the same, to cost not exceeding eight thousand
         dollars.
      
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 5.
      
      The United States agrees that the agent for said Indians shall in the future make his home at the agency-building; that he shall reside among them, and keep
         an office open at all times for the purpose of prompt and diligent inquiry into such matters of complaint by and against the
         Indians as may be presented for investigation under the provisions of their treaty stipulations, as also for the faithful
         discharge of other duties enjoined on him by law. In all cases of depredation on person or property he shall cause the evidence
         to be taken in writing and forwarded, together with his findings, to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, whose decision, subject
         to the revision of the Secretary of the Interior, shall be binding on the parties to this treaty.
      
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 6.
      
      If any individual belonging to said tribes of Indians, or legally incorporated with them, being the head of a family, shall desire to commence farming, he shall have the privilege to select, in the presence and with the assistance
         of the agent then in charge, a tract of land within said reservation, not exceeding three hundred and twenty acres in extent,
         which tract, when so selected, certified, and recorded in the “land-book,” as herein directed, shall cease to be held in common,
         but the same may be occupied and held in the exclusive possession of the person selecting it, and of his family, so long as
         he or they may continue to cultivate it.Any person over eighteen years of age, not being the head of a family, may in like manner select and cause to be certified to him or her, for purposes of cultivation, a quantity of land not exceeding
         eighty acres in extent, and thereupon be entitled to the exclusive possession of the same as above directed.
      
      
      Page 1000
      
      For each tract of land so selected a certificate, containing a description thereof and the name of the person selecting it, with a certificate endorsed thereon
         that the same has been recorded, shall be delivered to the party entitled to it, by the agent, after the same shall have been
         recorded by him in a book to be kept in his office, subject to inspection, which said book shall be known as the “Sioux Land-Book.”The President may, at any time, order a survey of the reservation, and, when so surveyed, Congress shall provide for protecting the rights of said settlers in their
         improvements, and may fix the character of the title held by each. The United States may pass such laws on the subject of
         alienation and descent of property between the Indians and their descendants as may be thought proper. And it is further stipulated
         that any male Indians, over eighteen years of age, of any band or tribe that is or shall hereafter become a party to this
         treaty, who now is or who shall hereafter become a resident or occupant of any reservation or Territory not included in the
         tract of country designated and described in this treaty for the permanent home of the Indians, which is not mineral land,
         nor reserved by the United States for special purposes other than Indian occupation, and who shall have made improvements
         thereon of the value of two hundred dollars or more, and continuously occupied the same as a homestead for the term of three
         years, shall be entitled to receive from the United States a patent for one hundred and sixty acres of land including his said improvements, the same to be in the form of the legal subdivisions
         of the surveys of the public lands. Upon application in writing, sustained by the proof of two disinterested witnesses, made
         to the register of the local land-office when the land sought to be entered is within a land district, and when the tract
         sought to be entered is not in any land district, then upon said application and proof being made to the Commissioner of the
         General Land-Office, and the right of such Indian or Indians to enter such tract or tracts of land shall accrue and be perfect
         from the date of his first improvements thereon, and shall continue as long as he continues his residence and improvements,
         and no longer. And any Indian or Indians receiving a patent for land under the foregoing provisions, shall thereby and from thenceforth become and
         be a citizen of the United States, and be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of such citizens, and shall, at the
         same time, retain all his rights to benefits accruing to Indians under this treaty.
      
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 7.
      
      In order to insure the civilization of the Indians entering into this treaty, the necessity of education is admitted, especially of such of them as are or may be settled on said agricultural reservations, and they therefore
         pledge themselves to compel their children, male and female, between the ages of six and sixteen years, to attend school; and it is hereby made the duty of
         the agent for said Indians to see that this stipulation is strictly complied with; and the United States agrees that for every
         thirty children between said ages who can be induced or compelled to attend school, a house shall be provided and a teacher competent to teach the elementary branches of an English education shall be
         furnished, who will reside among said Indians, and faithfully discharge his or her duties as a teacher. The provisions of
         this article to continue for not less than twenty years.
      
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 8.
      
      When the head of a family or lodge shall have selected lands and received his certificate as above directed, and the agent
         shall be satisfied that he intends in good faith to commence cultivating the soil for a living, he shall be entitled to receive
         seeds and agricultural implements for the first year, not exceeding in value one hundred dollars, and for each succeeding
         year he shall continue to farm, for a period of three years more, he shall be entitled to receive seeds and implements as
         aforesaid, not exceeding in value twenty-five dollars.And it is further stipulated that such persons as commence farming shall receive instruction from the farmer herein provided for, and
      
      
      Page 1001
      
      whenever more than one hundred persons shall enter upon the cultivation of the soil, a second blacksmith shall be provided, with such iron, steel, and other material as may be needed.
      
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 9.
      
      At any time after ten years from the making of this treaty, the United States shall have the privilege of withdrawing the
         physician, farmer, blacksmith, carpenter, engineer, and miller herein provided for, but in case of such withdrawal, an additional sum thereafter of ten thousand dollars per annum shall be devoted to the education of said Indians, and the Commissioner
         of Indian Affairs shall, upon careful inquiry into their condition, make such rules and regulations for the expenditure of
         said sum as will best promote the educational and moral improvement of said tribes.
      
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 10.
      
      In lieu of all sums of money or other annuities provided to be paid to the Indians herein named, under any treaty or treaties
         heretofore made, the United States agrees to deliver at the agency-house on the reservation herein named, on or before the
         first day of August of each year, for thirty years, the following articles, to wit:For each male person over fourteen years of age, a suit of good substantial woolen clothing, consisting of coat, pantaloons, flannel shirt, hat, and a pair of home-made socks.For each female over twelve years of age, a flannel skirt, or the goods necessary to make it, a pair of woolen hose, twelve
         yards of calico, and twelve yards of cotton domestics.For the boys and girls under the ages named, such flannel and cotton goods as may be needed to make each a suit as aforesaid,
         together with a pair of woolen hose for each.And in order that the Commissioner of Indian Affairs may be able to estimate properly for the articles herein named, it shall
         be the duty of the agent each year to forward to him a full and exact census of the Indians, on which the estimate from year to year can be based.And in addition to the clothing herein named, the sum of ten dollars for each person entitled to the beneficial effects of
         this treaty shall be annually appropriated for a period of thirty years, while such persons roam and hunt, and twenty dollars
         for each person who engages in farming, to be used by the Secretary of the Interior in the purchase of such articles as from time to time the condition and necessities of the Indians may indicate to be proper. And if within the thirty years, at any time, it shall appear that the amount of money needed for clothing under this article can be appropriated
         to better uses for the Indians named herein, Congress may, by law, change the appropriation to other purposes; but in no event
         shall the amount of this appropriation be withdrawn or discontinued for the period named. And the President shall annually
         detail an officer of the Army to be present and attest the delivery of all the goods herein named to the Indians, and he shall inspect and report on
         the quantity and quality of the goods and the manner of their delivery. And it is hereby expressly stipulated that each Indian
         over the age of four years, who shall have removed to and settled permanently upon said reservation and complied with the
         stipulations of this treaty, shall be entitled to receive from the United States, for the period of four years after he shall
         have settled upon said reservation, one pound of meat and one pound of flour per day, provided the Indians cannot furnish their own subsistence at an earlier date. And it
         is further stipulated that the United States will furnish and deliver to each lodge of Indians or family of persons legally
         incorporated with them, who shall remove to the reservation herein described and commence farming, one good American cow, and one good well-broken pair of American oxen within sixty days after such lodge or family shall have so settled upon
         said reservation.
      
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 11.
      
      In consideration of the advantages and benefits conferred by this treaty, and the many pledges of friendship by the
      
      Page 1002
      
      United States, the tribes who are parties to this agreement hereby stipulate that they will relinquish all right to occupy permanently the territory outside their reservation as herein defined, but yet reserve the right to hunt on any lands north of North Platte, and on the Republican Fork of the Smoky Hill River, so long as the buffalo
         may range thereon in such numbers as to justify the chase. And they, the said Indians, further expressly agree:1st. That they will withdraw all opposition to the construction of the railroads now being built on the plains.2d. That they will permit the peaceful construction of any railroad not passing over their reservation as herein defined.3d. That they will not attack any persons at home, or travelling, nor molest or disturb any wagon-trains, coaches, mules, or cattle
         belonging to the people of the United States, or to persons friendly therewith.4th. They will never capture, or carry off from the settlements, white women or children.5th. They will never kill or scalp white men, nor attempt to do them harm.6th. They withdraw all pretence of opposition to the construction of the railroad now being built along the Platte River and westward
         to the Pacific Ocean, and they will not in future object to the construction of railroads, wagon-roads, mail-stations, or
         other works of utility or necessity, which may be ordered or permitted by the laws of the United States. But should such roads
         or other works be constructed on the lands of their reservation, the Government will pay the tribe whatever amount of damage may be assessed by three disinterested commissioners to be appointed by the President for that purpose, one of said
         commissioners to be a chief or head-man of the tribe.7th. They agree to withdraw all opposition to the military posts or roads now established south of the North Platte River, or that may be established, not in violation of treaties
         heretofore made or hereafter to be made with any of the Indian tribes.
      
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 12.
      
      No treaty for the cession of any portion or part of the reservation herein described which may be held in common shall be
         of any validity or force as against the said Indians, unless executed and signed by at least three-fourths of all the adult
         male Indians, occupying or interested in the same; and no cession by the tribe shall be understood or construed in such manner
         as to deprive, without his consent, any individual member of the tribe of his rights to any tract of land selected by him,
         as provided in article 6 of this treaty.
      
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 13.
      
      The United States hereby agrees to furnish annually to the Indians the physician, teacher, carpenter, miller, engineer, farmer,
         and blacksmiths as herein contemplated, and that such appropriations shall be made from time to time, on the estimates of
         the Secretary of the Interior, as will be sufficient to employ such persons.
      
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 14.
      
      It is agreed that the sum of five hundred dollars annually, for three years from date, shall be expended in presents to the ten persons of said tribe who in the judgment of the agent may grow the most valuable crops for the respective
         year.
      
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 15.
      
      The Indians herein named agree that when the agency-house or other buildings shall be constructed on the reservation named,
         they will regard said reservation their permanent home, and they will make no permanent settlement elsewhere; but they shall have the right, subject
         to the conditions and modifications of this treaty, to hunt, as stipulated in Article 11 hereof.
      
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 16.
      
      The United States hereby agrees and stipulates that the country north of the North Platte River and east of the summits of
         the Big Horn Mountains shall be held and considered to be unceded Indian territory, and also stipulates and agrees that no white person or persons shall be permitted to settle upon or occupy any portion of
      
      
      Page 1003
      
      the same; or without the consent of the Indians first had and obtained, to pass through the same; and it is further agreed
         by the United States that within ninety days after the conclusion of peace with all the bands of the Sioux Nation, the military
         posts now established in the territory in this article named shall be abandoned, and that the road leading to them and by
         them to the settlements in the Territory of Montana shall be closed.
      
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 17.
      
      It is hereby expressly understood and agreed by and between the respective parties to this treaty that the execution of this
         treaty and its ratification by the United States Senate shall have the effect, and shall be construed as abrogating and annulling all treaties and agreements heretofore entered into between the
         respective parties hereto, so far as such treaties and agreements obligate the United States to furnish and provide money,
         clothing, or other articles of property to such Indians and bands of Indians as become parties to this treaty, but no further.

         have hereunto set our hands and seals at Fort Laramie, Dakota Territory, this twenty-ninth day of April, in the year one thousand
