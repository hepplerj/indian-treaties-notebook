      In a convention held this twenty-seventh day of September 1836, between Henry Dodge Superintendent of Indian Affairs, and
         the chiefs, braves, and principal men of the Sac and Fox tribe of Indians, it has been represented, that according to the
         stipulations of the first article of the treaty of Prairie du Chien, of the 15th July 1830, the country thereby ceded, is
         “to be assigned and allotted under the direction of the President of the United States, to the tribes now living thereon,
         or to such other tribes as the President may locate thereon for hunting and other purposes.” And, whereas, it is further represented
         to us, the chiefs, braves, and principal men of the tribe aforesaid, to be desirable that the lands lying between the State
         of Missouri and the Missouri river should be attached to, and become a part of said State, and the Indian title thereto be
         entirely extinguished; but that, notwithstanding, as these lands compose a part of the country embraced by the provisions
         of said first article of the treaty aforesaid, the stipulations thereof will be strictly observed until the assent of the
         Indians interested is given to the proposed measure.Now, we the chiefs, braves, and principal men of the Sac and Fox tribes of Indians, fully understanding the subject, and well
         satisfied from the local position of the lands in question, that they can never be made available for Indian purposes, and that an attempt to place an Indian population
         on them must inevitably lead to collisions with the citizens of the United States; and further believing that the extension
         of the State line in the direction indicated, would have a happy effect, by presenting a natural boundary between the whites
         and Indians; and, willing moreover, to give the United States a renewed evidence of our attachment and friendship, do hereby,
         for ourselves, and on behalf of our respective tribes (having full power and authority to this effect) forever cede, relinquish,
         and quit claim to the United States, all our right, title, and interest of whatsoever nature in, and to, the lands lying between
         the State of Missouri and the Missouri river, and do freely and fully exonerate the United States from any guarantee, condition,
         or limitation, expressed or implied, under the treaty of Prairie du Chien aforesaid, or otherwise, as to the entire and absolute
         disposition of the said lands, fully authorizing the United States to do with the same whatever shall seem expedient or necessary.
      
      
      
      In testimony whereof, we have hereunto set our hands and seals, the day and year first above written.
