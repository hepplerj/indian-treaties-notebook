         line of the state of Pennsylvania, extending north until it intersects the boundary line of the United States, and extending
         south it intersects a line heretofore established by the treaty of Grenville.
      
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 3.

         instalments of two thousand each; which several sums is the full amount of their proportion of the purchases effected by this
         treaty, and also by a treaty with said companies bearing even date herewith; which proportions were agreed on and concluded
         by the whole of said nations in their general council; which several sums, together with two thousand nine hundred and sixteen
         dollars and sixty seven cents, secured to the President, to raise said sum of one hundred and seventy five dollars annuity
         as aforesaid, is the amount of the consideration paid by the agents of the Connecticut Reserve, for the cession of their lands.
