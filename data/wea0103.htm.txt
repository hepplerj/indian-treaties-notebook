      A convention entered into at Vincennes, in the Indiana territory, between William Henry Harrison, commissioner plenipotentiary
            of the United States, for treating with the Indian tribes north-west of the Ohio and the Wea tribe.
      
      
      The said tribe, by their Sachems and head warriors, hereby declare their full and free consent to the treaty concluded at fort Wayne, on the thirtieth ultimo, by the above mentioned commissioner, with the Delaware,
         Miami, Putawatimie, and Eel river tribes; and also to the separate article entered into on the same day with the Miami and
         Eel river tribes. And the said commissioner, on the part of the United States, agrees to allow the said Indian tribe an additional
         annuity of three hundred dollars, and a present sum of fifteen hundred dollars, in consideration of the relinquishment made
         in the first article of said treaty;
