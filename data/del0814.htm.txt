    Whereas, by the treaty of Sarcoxieville, amended by the United States Senate, and finally ratified by the President of the United States on the 22d day of August, 1860, a principal object of both parties was the construction of a certain contemplated railroad therein named; and to that end the Leavenworth, Pawnee, and Western Railroad Company were to pay into the United States Treasury, in gold or silver coin, a sum of money, afterwards ascertained to be $286,742.15, as the appraised value of certain lands in Kansas belonging to the Delaware tribe of Indians; which sum of money, after expending a sufficient part of it to enable the Indians to commence agricultural pursuits under favorable circumstances, was to be, by the President, for said Indians, invested in safe and profitable stocks; and
    Whereas the said railroad company is not able to pay said sum of money within time, according to said treaty; and
    Whereas the President is of opinion that it is not for the interest of either party that said object of the treaty shall fail, but not knowing what would be the desire of said Indians on this point, nor knowing whether any part of said sum would be needed to enable the Indians to commence agricultural pursuits under favorable circumstances, but supposing it probable that no part of it would be so needed, as said Indians now have over fifty thousand dollars lying idle in the United States Treasury; Therefore—
    It is directed by the President that said Railroad Company may execute their bonds, with interest-warrants or coupons attached, according to the forms hereto annexed, the principal of which bonds shall amount to the aggregate sum of $286,742.15, and deposit the same with Archibald Williams, of Kansas, hereby appointed to receive and receipt for the same, to be by him transmitted to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs for the use of said Indians; and also shall, in due and proper form, execute a mortgage upon one hundred thousand acres of the land contemplated in and by said treaty to aid in the construction of said railroad, the said one hundred thousand acres to be the lands designated in the letter of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to the Secretary of the Interior, dated May 29, 1861; said mortgage to be conditioned for the full payment of said bonds, both as to interest and principal, and that on any failure to pay either when due all right and interest of said railroad company in and to said mortgaged land, and also to all such of said land not mortgaged as shall not at that time be earned and patented according to said treaty, shall be forfeited, and said land again become the absolute property of the United States
    
    
    
      Page 821
    
    in trust for said Indians; and said mortgaged lands to be in no event patented to said until said bonds, principal and interest, shall be fully paid. And upon said bonds being so made and deposited, and said mortgage being so executed and duly recorded in Leavenworth County, Kansas, all matters, so far as not necessarily varied by this arrangement, shall proceed in conformity to said treaty, as if the money had been paid by said railroad company and had been invested by the President in said railroad bonds: Provided always, That this arrangement shall be of no effect until Archibald Williams, judge of the United States court for the district of Kansas, shall have endorsed a certificate upon this paper that he has carefully examined the same, and also the bonds and mortgage offered in compliance with its provisions, and has found that bonds and mortgage do in fact comply with and fulfil said provisions; and also that he has had before him the chiefs and headmen named in said treaty, as John Connor, Sar-cox-ie, Necon-he-con, and Rock-a-to-wha, and has fully explained to them the nature and effect of this departure from the terms of said treaty, and that they freely assented to the same.
