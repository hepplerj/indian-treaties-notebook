      THE said United States of America, by William Henry Harrison, late a major general in the army of the United States, and Lewis
         Cass, governor of the Michigan territory, duly authorized and appointed commissioners for the purpose, and the said tribes,
         by their head men, chiefs, and warriors, assembled at Greenville, in the state of Ohio, have agreed to the following articles,
         which, when ratified by the president of the United States, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate thereof, shall
         be binding upon them and the said tribes.
      
      
      
      ARTICLE 1.
      
      The United States and the Wyandots, Delawares, Shawanoese, and Senecas, give peace to the Miamie nation of Indians, formerly designated as the Miamie Eel River and Weea tribes; they extend this
         indulgence also to the bands of the Putawatimies, which adhere to the Grand Sachem Tobinipee, and to the chief Onoxa, to the
         Ottawas of Blanchard's creek, who have attached themselves to the Shawanoese tribe, and to such of the said tribe as adhere
         to the chief called the Wing, in the neighborhood of Detroit, and to the Kickapoos, under the direction of their chiefs who
